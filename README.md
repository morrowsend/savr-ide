# savr-ide
 Simple AVR IDE for ASM coding  This is a little project I did in the spring of 2007. I was just starting with AVR chips and couldn''t find a simple, small IDE to use, so I wrote one. The Simple AVR IDE (SAVR) is a tiny IDE that incorporates an open source assembler (AVRA) and an open source uploader/downloader (AVRDUDE).  I wrote it in C++ using FLTK. The whole thing (including source code) is about 2.5MB.  If you use it, please leave me some feedback. I know its not that great, and could use some more functions, but it did all I needed it to do.
